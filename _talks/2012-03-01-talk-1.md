Sexual selection often drives the evolution of conspicuous sexual signals but natural selection can oppose the forces of sexual selection to result in more cryptic signals. The acoustic parasitoid fly *Ormia ochracea* is an eavesdropper of field cricket calling songs. Parasitism by *O. ochracea* results in host cricket death. Among some Hawiian cricket populations, this has caused the rapid spread of ‘flatwing’ males that lack the ability to produce calling songs. Recently, novel song types have emerged. The extent to which Hawaiian *O. ochracea* able to detect and respond to these novel songs, and whether flies across different Hawaiian populations exhibit differences in their auditory tuning is not well understood. We quantify behavioral response thresholds of flies performing walking phonotaxis on a spherical treadmill system in response to cricket songs that vary in carrier frequency and sound intensity. To examine the sensory basis of these behavioral responses, we quantify neural response thresholds with extracellular recordings from the cervical neck connective of *O. ochracea*. We compare and discuss differences in response thresholds across different populations of *O. ochracea*.
