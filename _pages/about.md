======



I was born and raised in Hanoi, Vietnam. After finshed high school, I moved to Northfiled, Minnesota to attned St. Olaf College. 
The combination of mathematics and neuroscience never occured to me until I was exposed to classes beyond the general curriculum.

I'm currently in the process of applying to gradute school for applied mathematics and computational neurosciecne with focus on computational topology and Behavioral modeling. 

At St Olaf, I am the coligiate football team manager. In my free time, I enjoy cooking, playing badminton, listening to podcasts.
Being an St. Olaf student has given me oppotunities to travel, experince, and make meanginful relationship around the world.
